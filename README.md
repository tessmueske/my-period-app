[ Crimson ~ For Queer People who Menstruate with Gender-Neutral Language ]

The mission was to create an app for users of all genders who menstruate that allows them to track their menstruation without gendered language about bodies or products.

A couple of years ago, I set out to try to find a period-tracking app that wasn't pink, used terms like "feminine products", or was all about having a woman's body. I couldn't find that app. Having a period can be hard enough, especially with dismissive medical providers and experiences like Polycystic Ovarian Symdrome (PCOS) or endometriosis. Trans folks and people who desire non-gendered language to refer to their bodies have the additional struggle of experiencing dysphoria and being mis-gendered while bleeding. I wanted to try to close this gap and make the experience of menstratuion a bit less painful for those folks. 

I polled my Instagram followers about what language feels best for them regarding menstruation. It seems that both menstruation and period causes dysphoria for different people. Others prefer "bleeding", "monthly", or other various terms. Some people preferred using terms such as "on the rag" in a joking manner. I chose to call my project "Crimson" in hopes that it detracted from the focus solely on the words "menstruation" or "period", also adding a nudge to those who preferred words such as "bleeding". 

I chose a dark grey as the background color for my project because it emits the least amount of carbon. Other choices for colors were also made with this research in mind (dark red, for example).

[ FEATURES ]

Users have the ability to create a new account, saving their sensisitve medical information in their own account with an email and hashed password.

Once logged in, there is a navigation bar at the top of the page that allows users to navigate between adding a new period, viewing all of their periods, their homepage, and logging out. Users can also add or delete symptoms from each period, and they can delete periods altogether, all from their calendar. I implemented confirmation checks so users don't accidentally delete periods they don't intend to, and I enabled redirection using React's useNavigate.

Considerations for future expansions:

Accessibiliy features
Language translations 
Filter by a symptom to see its prevalence (how many periods it is associated with)
Recommend Doctors
Surgery Information
Sex Education (STIs, contraception, etc)
Guest speakers/teach-ins - how to family-build in queer relationships, hormones and wanted/unwanted changes, queer history, etc
Meeting friends function
Dating function
Hookup function
Message/Chat groups (think Lex groups, Reddit threads)
